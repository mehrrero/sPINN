# singular_PINNs
PINNs to solve differential equations with singular points in the integration domain

- To get notebooks from .py  --- If using jupyter, right click, open as notebook. Otherwise, use jupytext to sinchronize them with a .ipynb.
- The new functions are inside sPINN init file. Once loaded in jupyter as a package (import sPINN or from sPINN import *) their help can be accessed by ? before the command.
- Plots for the paper cannot be run live, since they require to train the network several times to produce all the curves.
